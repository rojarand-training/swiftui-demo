## Positioning image

- `scaledToFit` - image is scaled to match the smallest dimension of its frame
- `scaledToFill` - image is scaled to match the biggest dimension of its frame

- `aspectRation` - works as `scaledToFit` or `scaledToFill` but also allows controlling how much a view is stretched or filled.
